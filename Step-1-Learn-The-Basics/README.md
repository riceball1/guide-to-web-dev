## My Take

Learning the basics for web development starts with understanding the foundations of what makes up the web. Here, the three topics presented: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the 3 foundations to a basic site. 

A site is simply a location like www.wikipedia.com where you can access multiple pages of information. You are able to interact and see content due to the fact these sites use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Respectively, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to give a page structure, style, and interactivity. 

When I first started to learn web development, I spent my first few weeks learning the basics of these three things. And overtime as a frontend leaning software developer, I learned deeper in the areas of each, tho sometimes some are less needed depending on my work tasks as others. These all will vary depending on the team, role, and projects you may have in your job.
