# JavaScript Basics

**JavaScript** (aka JS) is a programming language that is commonly used for the World Wide Web. JavaScript typically is used to handle the client-side behavior of a site.

## Basic Programming Concepts

For any programming language there are basics concepts that can be generally found across all programming languages. 

### **Data Structures**

It's important to be aware of what the data structures are that commonly exists in programming langauges and how to access and modify them.


| Data Structure | Example |
|---| ---|
|arrays | `[1, 2, 3]` |
|objects | `{ id: 1234}` |

### **Loop/Interations**

Generally to iterate over values in JS you would need to be able to understand how to use loops.

```javascript

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Loop through the nums array
for ( let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // print to the console each value from the nums array starting at index 0
    console.log(nums[i]);
}

// Output: 1 2 3 4 5

```
